PICOBIT
------

This is my version of Picobit, a small Scheme System designed to run on small microcontrollers. I made the portability of PICOBIT to STM32F100RB.

It consists of 2 parts, a scheme compiler and a VM.

  * The scheme compiler was written in Racket Language, it usually run
  on a PC/workstation. Its function is compile the scheme code to
  bytecode.

  * The Virtual Machine is a bytecode interpreter. In this case it is
  compiled to run on a microcontroller(STM32F1-value line). The VM is
  written in (mostly) portable C.
